# Non Profit bloggers
It's hard nowadays to find people who write for the joy of writing. I hope to compile a list of blogs from people who find joy in writing.

To be added to this list, your blog should meet the following criteria: 
1. No ads
2. Selling services/merchandise shouldn't be the primary goal
3. Sponsored posts should be at a bare minimum
4. Your blog shouldn't be written by AI

We will prioritize blogs on the list by those who also do not require cookies, and have minimal data tracking. 

### Submit your website
Create a Pull reuqest or create a new issue with the following information:
1. Category
2. Title of the blog
3. URL
4. (Optional) Emoji that represents your blog, this will be displayed before the name of your blog.

### Removal of websites from the list
Every once in a while I may go through the list to see which blogs are still active.

If you find a blog in the list has gone in the way of ads or extensive tracking or has simply shutdown, please flag it so it may be removed.

Happy blogging and reading!
