# Non Profit bloggers
It's hard nowadays to find people who write for the joy of writing. I hope to compile a list of blogs in this Readme of people who find joy in writing.

To be added to this list, your blog shouldn't have any ads and selling services/merchandise shouldn't be the primary target.

We will prioritize blogs on the list by those who also do not require cookies, and have minimal to know data tracking.

Want to get on the list? Simply create a PR or new issue with the title of your blog, category and link for review. If you find a blog in the list has gone in the way of ads or extensive tracking, please let me know and I will remove it from the list.

Happy blogging and reading!
