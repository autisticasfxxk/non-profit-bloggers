# üíú Non-profit bloggers
It's hard nowadays to find people who write for the joy of writing. I hope to compile a list of blogs from people who find joy in writing.

If you would like to share your passion of writing without the need of monetary motivation - I've created a badge below you may display on your blog and link to this page.

Replace the image URL represented as `{badge link here}` with the proper URL from your own server:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/uxai/non-profit-bloggers/" target="_blank">
  <img src="{badge link here}" alt="Non-profit bloggers badge">
</a>
```

### üôÖ Removal of websites from the list
Every once in a while I may go through the list to see which blogs are still active.

If you find a blog in the list has gone in the way of ads or extensive tracking or has simply shutdown, please flag it so it may be removed.

Happy blogging and reading!
